## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r drug-market, results="asis", warning=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(drug_market, 
                varnumbers   = FALSE,
                valid.col    = FALSE,
                graph.magnif = 0.76), 
      max.tbl.height = 300,
      method = "render")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
drug_market %>%
  descr(stats = "common") %>%
  tb()
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
