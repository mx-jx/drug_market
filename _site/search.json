    "text": "The value and effects of southern Africa’s drug market is increasing. However, little is known about drug sellers and the nature of drug sales in the region. We examined the characteristics of people who supply heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine (drugs) at retail and wholesale levels in South Africa.\n\n\n\nParticipants in this cross-sectional study included people who sell drugs who were recruited from nine South African cities between May – November 2020. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing seller attributes and sale characteristics. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics.\n\n\n\nAmong the 176 participants, people sold heroin (n=139), methamphetamine (n=62) and cocaine (n=85), with X% selling trnah oend[[sjv . Overall, 93% (n=159) were male, X% sold multiple drugs and people had been working for a median of 5 years (IQR X – X). Overall, X% (n=X) sold to consumers (retail), X% (n=X) to sellers and consumers (wholesale ), and X% (n=X) exclusively to sellers. Among retail sellers, the median weekly amount of heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine sold was Xg (IQR X – X), Xg (IQR X – X), and Xg (IQR X – X), respectively, to X and X and X consumers, respectively. Among wholesale sellers, heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine was sold at a median of Xg (IQR Xg – Xg), Xg (IQR Xg – Xg), and Xg (IQR Xg – Xg) to X and X and X sellers, respectively.\n\n\n\nThis study is the first to describe the characteristics of people who sell drugs and nature of sales in South Africa. These data could be useful to inform definitions and thresholds for possession and supply in drug legislation."
